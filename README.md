# Customer-Segmentation

A Mall has information about the customers such as age, gender and income.They have given a spending score to all the customers based on the spendings that the customers made in order to segregate their customers but the mall has no idea on how many groups they want to segregate their customers into.This problem is clearly a unsupervised learning so tried to segregate the cutsomers into groups  using Kmeans and Agglomerative hierarchical clsutering from scikit-learn library and named the groups as careful, standard, careless, sensible and Target.

Note: kmeans clustering is good for large datasets but in hierarchical clustering as we are determing the optimal number of clusters from the dendogram so it is not best when used with a large dataset.
